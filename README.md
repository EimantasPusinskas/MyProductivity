This project was created as an entry for UCC's Netsoc's Hackathon by myself Eimantas Pusinskas, Patrick Lenihan and Eoin O'Sullivan.     
The theme of the hackathon was "Working and Studying From Home." 


# Why did we choose to do this project?
We decided to create MyProductivity as a way to increase people's productivity and make working/studying from home as simple and carefree as possible.
We noticed a lot of students struggling to adjust to online learning and so we created this app to try to solve that problem.


# What does this app do?
This app allows you to input the times of your weekly lectures/labs/meetings and the hyperlinks asssociated with these online meetings.
This information is then used to create a simple timetable which you can view anytime.

You can access the hyperlinks to your Teams/Zoom/Hangouts meetings either by clicking on the designated buttons in the app or by using the in-built voice assistant. 
For the voice assistant, you can create custom voice commands for each link. For example, you can create a command named "Open Teams" for a Microsoft Teams link and so once you 
activate the voice assistant and say "Open Teams" out loud, Microsoft Teams will open up. 

Finally, you can use the "Plan an Event" facility to help you plan your own event/meeting. This facility takes your timetable infromation and compresses it into a simple ~20 digit code.
You may then use this code accompanied with other people's code to find times when everyone is free to schedule an event/meeting.
